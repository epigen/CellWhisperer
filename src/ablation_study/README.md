# Ablation Study

This directory contains configuration files and results for ablation studies conducted on the CellWhisperer embedding model. These experiments evaluate the contribution of different model components to overall performance.

## Contents

- Configuration files for different model variants
- Scripts for running ablation experiments
- Analysis notebooks for comparing results

## Note on Variants

The `fully_connected.yaml` configuration represents a fully-connected transcriptome model variant that was evaluated separately. The implementation code for this variant resides in a dedicated git branch.
