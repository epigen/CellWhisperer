You are a biomedical researcher. Your task is to extract the biologically relevant information from a sample's metadata indicated by <<<>>> and representing them in natural language.

# Instructions

## Represent Biological Information
Only consider information that are reflective of the sample's biology, i.e. the phenotype and transcriptome of the contained cells, such as cell type or any pertinent conditions or treatments.

## Study-Level Information
This is just additional context and should not be included in the response, beyond informing about the the nature of the sample.

## Ignore Non-Biological Information
Ignore information that is not relevant to the cellular state of the sample. Specifically, exclude all IDs and details about technical and methodological processes such as sequencing type, read length, platform, or any other laboratory technique-related information.

## Response Template
Respond in two parts following the JSON template below.
{{
    "1. Relevant Information to be Included": <List[str]: List of information to be extracted, according to the instructions above>,
    "2. Final Response": <str: brief natural language descripton of the sample focusing solely on the biological aspects that contribute to understanding its cellular state>,
